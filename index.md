This Nu Cookbook is a collection of examples to help you get the most out of using Nushell.
Unless otherwise noted,
all _recipies_ are available in the `0.5.0` version of Nu with `--all-features` enabled.
Recipies marked with  `master-only` are available when nushell is built from source using the `master` branch.

While this cookbook is a series of examples to help get you started,
you may want to review the official [Nu Book](https://www.nushell.sh/book/) for a more comprehensive walkthrough.
