# Nu Cookbook

You can via it live at [www.nushell.sh/cookbook/](https://www.nushell.sh/cookbook/).

In contrary to the [Nu Book](https://www.nushell.sh/book/), cookbook doesn't cover all the basic concepts and ideas behind Nu. It is more a addition to help you get the most out of using Nushell. This includes:

* Answering the question "How do I do X in Nu?"
* Multiple ways of expressing the same pipelines
* Some cool oneliners
